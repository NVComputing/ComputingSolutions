# Welcome to the NVComputing Practice Problem Solutions!
Some of these solutions are written by **you**. So, if your submission is quality, chances are it will be featured here! All submissions are anonymous unless you want to
shout out during the meeting that the solution is yours.

Solutions will be posted one-two weeks after the problems are released, and we will go over them during the meeting in that week.

## How do I make my submission feature worthy *when considering programming problems*?
1. Solve the problem. We will not feature solutions that do not work.
2. Increase your code efficiency. We like it when code is fast.
3. Use different coding languages (maybe not Pascal). bWe will try to feature solutions of multiple languages so if you have the best solution of your language
then we will likely feature it.
4. If you leave a massive comment on the top of your code that says "FEATURE MY CODE", your chances of being featured will increase by 1.24%.
5. Make your code look pretty. If you don't indent your code correctly or use extremely cryptic variable names, we will probably not feature it.
