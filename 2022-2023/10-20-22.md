## Problem A - [Pasta](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc241/tasks/abc241_b)

To simplify, the problem asks to check if all the integers present in the second line of the input are also present in the first line of the input.
This can be checked by using a map to store the number of times each number occurs in the first set, or by simply binary searching (or searching normally) and seeing if the number is present.

Checking if each integer exists in the array:
```py
n, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
noods = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
days = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
for nood in days:
    try:
        i = noods.index(nood)
    except:
        print('No')
        exit()
    noods = noods[:i] + noods[i + 1:]
print('Yes')
```

Using a set:
```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {

	int n, d; cin >> n >> d;
	map <int, int> ns;
 
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) //put into a map
	{
		int a; cin >> a;
		ns[a]++;
	}
 
	for (int i = 0; i < d; i++)
	{
		int a; cin >> a; 
		if (ns[a] > 0){ //if it exists in the map...
			ns[a]--;
		}
		else
		{
			cout << "No"; //noodle is not in map, output no
			exit(0);
		}
	}
	cout << "Yes";
}
```

## Problem B - [(K+1)-th Largest Number](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc273/tasks/abc273_c)

The problem asks to find *how many ways* we can pick an integer from the array such that there are K distinct integers greater than it.
By placing all of the integers in a sorted set, we can traverse backwards through the set to identify which numbers we should pick from the array such that there are K distinct integers greater than it.
For example, there would be 0 distinct integers greater than the largest integer in the set (let's call this *x*).
Thus, the number of ways to choose an integer in the array such that there are 0 distinct integers greater than it is simply the number of times *x* appears in the array.
After iterating through the set, all remaining values of K have 0 ways to pick numbers: if there's only 4 distinct integers int array, it would be impossible to pick an number and still have 4 distinct integers greater than it.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
// :(
 
int main() {
	int n; cin >> n;
	list<int> l; //this list is treated like a set in the code
	map <int, int> g;
 
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
		int x; cin >> x;
		if (g.count(x) == 0){
			l.push_back(x);
		}
		g[x]++;
	}
	l.sort(greater<int>()); //sort greatest first
 
	list<int>::iterator it; //iterate through set
	int c = 0;
	for (it = l.begin(); it != l.end(); it++)
	{
		cout << g[*it] << endl;
		c++;
	}
	for (c = c; c < n; c++){
		cout << 0 << endl;
	}
}
```

## Problem C - [Manga](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc271/tasks/abc271_c)

To solve the problem, we need to determine, starting from volume 1, for each volume, does Takahashi either a) have the volume or b) have enough books remaining to sell to buy the volume.
If he has the volume, then he saves that volume for later, and subtracts one from his total number of volumes.
If he doesn't have the volume, he needs to sell 2 other volumes to purchase it, and therefore needs to subtract 2 from his total number of books.
If he doesn't have the volume and doesn't have 2 books to sell, then he cannot read any more volumes. Therefore, the number of volumes he could read at that point is the answer.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// i hope takahashi's manga collection burns to ashes
 
int main() {

	int n; cin >> n; 
	int a; cin >> a;
	set<int>s;
 
	// if just one //to be honest i don't know this is here for i do not think this is necessary
                 //but then again i didn't write this code so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	if (n == 1){
		if(a == 1){
			cout << 1;
		}
		else{
			cout << 0;
		}
		exit(0);
	}
	s.insert(a);
	
	for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
		cin >> a;
		s.insert(a);
	}
 
	int nN = n;
	int c = 0;
	while (true){
		if (s.count(c + 1) && nN - 1 >= 0){
			nN -= 1;
			c++;
		}
		else if (nN - 2 >= 0){
			nN -= 2;
			c++;
		}
		else{
			break;
		}
	}
 
	cout << c;
}
```
