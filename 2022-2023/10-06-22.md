## Problem A - [484558](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc271/tasks/abc271_a)

Just involves converting a number into hex (base 16). Can do that using math or most languages have a built in function to convert ints into hex.

```py
s = '0123456789ABCDEF'
n = int(input())
print(s[int(n / 16)] + s[n % 16])
```

## Problem B - [Slot Strategy](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc252/tasks/abc252_c)

The amount of time it takes to all the reels on a number is equal to (the maximum amount of times that number occurs at an index * 10) + (the last index that that number occurs at)
It suffices to check the amount of time it takes for each number and pick the number with the best time.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
 
    int n; cin >> n;
    int pos[10][10];
    memset(pos, 0, sizeof(pos));
    string digits = "0123456789";
 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string str;
        cin >> str;
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            pos[j][str.find(digits[j])]++;
        }
    }
 
    int smol = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        int big = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            big = max(big, (pos[i][j] - 1) * 10 + j);
        }
        smol = min(smol, big);
    }
 
    cout << smol;
 
}
```

## Problem C - [Chinese Restaurant](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc268/tasks/abc268_c)

A brute force solution to check how many people are happy at each rotation would take O(nÂ²) time, O(n) to check each rotation * O(n) to check whether each person is happy with their plate.
A solution to reduce checking whether each person is happy is to store the distance each person is from their plate rather than the location of the plate. Upon rotating the table, all people who were x away from their plate would be x-1 away instead.

```py
N = int(input())
dishes = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
 
#basically, for each dish, you find for what rotations does it take to
#reach their target person.
 
#for that number rotations, you add 1 to count the person you made happy
#for that dish while iterating through each dish
 
#you keep the number of satisfied people for each rotation number
#find the largest amount of satisfied people
 
rotations = [0] * N
for i in range(len(dishes)):
    dish = dishes[i]
    rotations[(dish - i + 1) % N] += 1
    rotations[(dish - i) % N] += 1
    rotations[(dish - i - 1) % N] += 1
 
print(max(rotations))
 
```
