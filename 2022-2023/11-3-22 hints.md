## Problem A - [Ameba](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc274/tasks/abc274_c)
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Amoeba A sub i splits into ameobas 2i and 2i + 1. In other words, the index of the value in the input (i) indicates which new amoeba it splits into, and the value given in the input (A sub i) indicates the original amoeba that it splits from.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The children amoeba that the parent amoeba are one generation down the line from the original amoeba, so their generation is equal to the generation of the parent amoeba + 1.

## Problem B - [Counting Squares](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc275/tasks/abc275_c)

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Given 2 points, we can find 2 other points that are needed to make a square.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The input size is so small (10 * 10 = 100 points) that it is possible to iterate over every set of two points.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
The two other points can be found using the difference in x and y between the first two points (probably fiddle around with this on paper, I'm not sure how to explain the process). There's actually two different sets of two points that will complete the square, depending on whether you rotate the original line segment clockwise or counterclockwise.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Make sure you aren't counting the same square multiple times.

## Problem C - [digitnum](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc238/tasks/abc238_c)

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>

  f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 3 etc... f(9) = 9, so the sum of all f(x) from x=1 to x=9 is equal to 1+2+3...+9. This can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: (lowest number + highest number) * (number of numbers in the sequence / 2). Substituting in the values for this case, it would look like (1 + 9) * (9 / 2) = 45.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>

  f(1) = 1, f(10) = 1, f(100) = 1, f(1000) = 1, f(10000) = 1, etc...
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>

  Sample case 2 (where n=238) can be broken down like this: the sum of all f(x) from x=1 to x=9 + the sum of all f(x) from x=10 to x=99 + the sum of all f(x) from x=100 to x=238.

  You essentially are trying to add a summation of "n" for each digit range you have

  Lets say I have the number 173:
  You have to add the sum of 1-9, then 10-99 (but they're offset by 9 to be 1-90), then finally 100-173 (offset by 99, so 1-74)

  Essentially you can use the sum of an arithmetic series formula to accomplish the goal, but you can think of it instead in terms of the properties of summation
  This is derived from Sn = n/2 * (an + a0)

  This is a fundamental calculation for digitnum because it reduces the entire thing to near O(1) (with a very uncostly loop - we'll get to that)
  So for our precious number 173, you can think of f(1)...f(9) to be like this:
  ![img](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1027733600113790986/1040416802418733217/image.png)

  Now the cool part is that up until the actual number of digits of our num (173), it really is just 9 x 10^(i) (if i starts at 0)
  And so you just add this to your sum, so for 273 you have something like:
  9/2 * 10 + 90/2 * 91
  Because your total number of digits is 3, so you can calculate sum up till 2
  After that point, you just have to understand that for each number you must offset it by a large number of repeating 9's, kind of like the earlier example of 10 to 99, you subtract by 9 to get 1-90 
  Or like 100 to 999, you subtract by 99 to get 1-900, etc.

  Of course calculating that sucks, but you can also see it as 10^(n digits - 1) - 1 
  Therefore you can easily calculate it as (173 - 10^2 + 1 )/2 * (173 - 10^2 + 2) 
  (which is really just saying (173 - 99)/2 * ((173 - 99) + 1), looking like our sum of an arithmetic series)
  
  This is basically the digit num formula:

  ```
  For each number of digits increasing until the total number of digits - 1: do (9 * 10^(i))/2 * (9 * 10^(i) + 1)
  For the last calculation: do (value - 10^(size-1) + 1)/2 * (val - 10^(size-1) + 2)
  ```
  then do ur fancy modulus
